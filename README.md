Kirby Sendgrid Mailer - alpha


#### Description

It's pretty basic like I said since I stopped working on it. It was
never optimized or made to deploy to an entire list. I haven't had time
to complete it "just for fun" like I always intended even after it got
shot down at work.


#### "Instructions"

The content of e-mail files are in content/emails/.... anything in
"default" folders will be used in lieu of there being a custom template
(named them app-one and app-two for demo purposes here) being available.

The home.php template is a form that tests the mailer. The deploy.php
template compiles a preview with a link at the bottom to confirm the
send.

Add your sendgrid username and password into the deploy.php template near the bottom.


#### Addendum

If you have any questions let me know. You're welcome to use this if
it looks like it'll help, as long as whatever you release is free.
